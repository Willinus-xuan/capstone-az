## Project Title: Graph representation learning for patient classification [](./az.png)

## Background: 
Complex diseases are chronic conditions involving arrays of dysregulated biological reactions and often influenced by additional factors such as genetics, lifestyle, and environmental exposures. The heterogeneous nature of complex diseases presents a challenge to develop one-size-fit-all treatments and calls for personalized alternatives. To dissect the molecular mechanisms underlining the multi-facet manifestation of complex diseases, scientists have invested heavily to analyze gene expression patterns among different patient populations, leading to the discoveries of many population-specific gene sets or signatures. 

However, enriched gene sets analysis alone cannot explain causal relations. In addition, many important disease drivers are not differentially expressed. To address these shortcomings, weâ€™d like to explore knowledge graphs as a mean to ingest prior knowledge, especially in the context of causal effect, and apply graph representation learning to classify patient populations.


## Project Scope: 
1. Build graph models for inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) using public knowledge graphs and transcriptomics data from patient cohorts with treatment history. 
2. Perform graph representation learning to classify responders and non-responders. 
3. Stretch goal: Identify driving gene and pathway features to derive new insights. Transfer learning to develop new classifier on related treatments.

## Research Questions
- 1. Why do some patients respond to one drug but the others don't?
- 2. Can we identify the biological players (i.e., genes, proteins, biological pathways, etc.) that
differentiate the responders and the non-responders?

## Data
- 1. Published gene expression data collected by different research groups at different time from various tissues of anonymous IBD patients treated with different drugs
- 2. Public biomedical knowledge graphs, e.g., PrimeKB

## Research Findings
The research findings are documented in a research-oriented paper below. Additionally, I made a poster to better present the research findings.
